## Introduction

This project provides a clear and concise implementation of the fundamental OOP concepts in TypeScript. Each concept is demonstrated with simple and easy-to-understand examples. The goal is to help developers, especially those new to TypeScript, grasp the OOP principles and apply them in their projects.

## Features

- Implementation of key OOP concepts in TypeScript.
- Clear and concise examples with comments for better understanding.
- Modular and organized code structure following industry best practices.

## OOP Concepts Covered

### Classes and Objects

Classes are blueprints for creating objects. This project shows how to define classes, instantiate objects, and work with properties and methods.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class, with controlled access. This project demonstrates how to use access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public` to control access to class members.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This project illustrates how to extend a class and override methods.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. This project shows how to achieve polymorphism using method overriding.

### Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This project demonstrates how to use abstract classes and methods.

## Installation

To run the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-oop-concepts.git
    cd typescript-oop-concepts
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile the TypeScript code:**
    ```bash
    npx tsc
    ```

4. **Run the examples:**
    ```bash
    node dist/<filename>.js
    ```

## Usage

You can explore the OOP concepts by navigating through the `src` directory. Each concept has its own file, with descriptive comments explaining the implementation. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different scenarios.
